* An API server built with Rust axum, with a modular philosophy: features can be added easiliy.
  The API server consists of 2 main components:
     * IotTask executor, which listens for incoming messages and send commands from a remote user using MQTT.
     * WebTask executor, which creates API routes and serves them.
  These 2 components have a bidirectional channel theoretically to allow pushing messages.
* MongoDB for being schemaless, new features can be added easily without having to perform migrations.
